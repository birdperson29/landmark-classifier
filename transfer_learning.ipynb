The steps I took include selecting this architecture due to its use of depthwise separable convolutions and inverted residuals, which significantly reduce the number of parameters and computational cost while still effectively extracting important features from images. MobileNetV3 Large also incorporates squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules, allowing the network to focus on the most relevant features by adaptively emphasizing important channels. This makes the architecture particularly suitable for image processing tasks, as it can quickly and accurately identify key patterns in images.\n",
